# CISC2200 Spring 2024 Lab4

In this lab assignment, we practice **implementing stack using array list**, **using stack to reverse the order**,
and **working with inheritance**.

## Download starter code

**Note: I will add additional code, Makefile soon.**

From your terminal (mac or WSL/Ubunto) window, you can use the following command to download it:
```
git clone https://github.com/CISC2200-Spring2024/lab4.git
```

## Programming Environment Setup
If you haven't done so already, please set up programming environment our our own computer, by following [Setup Tutorial](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/). 

- The _Commannd Line Tools_ are required. 

- The _C++ Dev Environment_ (VSCode) is highly recommened.

**Please follow these tutorials closely and carefully.**

## Requirements:

Please implement the following member functions in the **AList.h**. 

1. Create a file named **stack.h** which implements a class template **stack** supporting **pop**, **top**, **push**, **is_empty** functions, it should use **AList** as provided to store the elements.
2. In the **SLLList.h** file, add a member function called **reverse_print**. This function shall use a stack to hold the elements in the list as one traverse the linked list, and
   afterwards, pop elements from the stack one by one to display them. This way, the items in the SLList are displayed in reversed order: the last element is displayed first, and the first element (at the bottom of the stak) is displayed last.
